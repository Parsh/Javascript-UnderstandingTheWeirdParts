    "### Syntax Parser\n",
    "![](./Images/SyntaxParser.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer technology, **a parser is a program, usually part of a compiler, that receives input in the form of sequential source program instructions**, interactive online commands, markup tags, or some other defined interface **and breaks them up into parts (for example, the nouns (objects), verbs (methods), and their attributes or options) that can then be managed by other components** (for example, other components in a compiler). A parser may also check to see that all input has been provided that is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lexical Environment\n",
    "![](./Images/LexicalEnvironment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about lexical environment for a given piece of code, say a function, we are basically talking about where that piece of code is written and what surrounds it. This is what compilers/interpreters takes into consideration while parsing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Context\n",
    "![](./Images/ExecutionContext.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that execution context not only just wraps the code that's running but it also contain code, injected by the execution engine (compiler/interpreter), beyond what we have provided. \n",

    "### Name-Value Pair\n",

    "## The Global Environment and The Global Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a code is run in JS, it runs inside an Execution context, built by the Execution Engine, to wrap the supplied code. **While running a JS program there are a few execution context running normally, however there is a base Execution context which is our Global Execution Context.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/GEandGO.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the JS Engine creates the Global Execution context, places our code into it and provides the following:\n",
    "- **Global Object**\n",
    "- a variable: **this**\n",
    "- a **link/reference to the Outer Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: At a global level, this = Global Object and Outer environment reference = null (cuz their is nothing outer to global context).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The execution environment was created by the JS Engine and therefore it decides what would be the Global Object and the value of this based on the context. For ex: In web browser the JS engine sets the Global Object as well as the value of this variable to be the **window object** (which is the global object for browsers), whereas for the server side, i.e., node js there would be some other global object, but there will always be a global object provided by the JS Engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to be clear, global in Javascript is anything that's not inside or lexically not inside a function. Therefore, any variable or function that isn't inside any function is globally accessible and is directly attached to the global object (window in browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Execution Context Creation and Hoisting\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the following scenario, what normally would you expect? \n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "\n",
    "b()\n",
    "console.log(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "var a = 'Hey There';\n",
    "\n",
    "function b(){\n",
    "    console.log('Greetings');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is something peculiar that's going to happen if we run that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Greetings\n",
    "undefined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we get such an output? Clearly that wouldn't have been the case in other programming languages. Instead of throwing an error, the function b got executed and console.log(a) produced something called undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, seemingly peculiar, output is a result of a phenomenon called **Hoisting**. To understand what hoisting is, we would need to look deeper into what happens when execution context is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Global Execution Context is created in 2 phases**:\n",
    "1. Creation Phase\n",
    "2. Execution Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Context (Creation Phase)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ExecContextCreation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, during the creation phase, the JS Engine sets up Global Object, this variable, reference to Outer Environment together with memory space for variables and functions. **This setting up of memory space for variables and functions at the time of execution context creation is referred, somewhat confusingly, as Hoisting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**So before the code (our code) begins to be executed line by line, the JS Engine already have set aside memory space for all the variables and the functions that we have created . Hence, those functions and the variables exists in memory prior to the execution phase.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the function is placed in its entirety, with its local variables, into the memory however the game with variables is a bit different, the assignment of values to the variables only takes place during the execution phase therefore Javascript Engine don't know, at the time of creation phase, what that value would be and hence it puts a placeholder called undefined** (that's why the output contained undefined while logging a). So, in short, all the variables are first initialized to undefined and gain their values during the execution phase whereas the functions are placed in the memory in their entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This elegantly proves the fact that we wrote isn't what's directly being executed rather an execution context is built which wraps our code along with other stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### undefined vs not defined(error)\n",
    "undefined is a trivial data type that JS uses to initialize it's variables during creation phase (it's simply a placeholder that represents the fact that nothing has been yet assigned to the given variable) whereas not defined error tells that the referenced variable doesn't exist in the scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Never explicitly set a variable to undefined, while it's completely valid to do that, however, this would create problems during debugging because we won't be able to differentiate that whether a variable is undefined cause we set it so or whether the JS Engine set it during the execution context creation phase and we never set it to anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Context (Execution Phase)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ExecContextExecution.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the execution phase we already have all things setup and now it runs our code line by line: interpreting it, converting it; compiling it and executing it on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(a);\n",
    "var a = 10;\n",
    "console.log(a);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "undefined\n",
    "10\n",
    "```\n",
    "During the creation phase, the variable a was initialized to undefined by the JS Engine, and when the execution phase begins (which is synchronous or line by line), the first log will result in undefined, then var a is assigned the value 10 and then it was logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Javascript is **Single Threaded**, i.e. it executes one command at a time and it's **Synchronous** which also means one at a time and in order.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the following program let's see what happens under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ExecutionStack.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we put this code in a Javascript file and run it, first of all the Global Execution context is going to be created, by JS Engine, which would wrap our code. <br><br>\n",
    "- During the global execution context's creation phase, the functions a and b will be brought into the memory and during the execution phase line by line execution of the our code will take place.<br><br>\n",
    "- During the execution phase, nothing is executed during the function definition as they aren't invoked but as we hit the statement a(), this is where function a is invoked, hence a new execution context is created in what's referred to as the Execution stack. Therefore, on a general note, **any time we invoke a function in javascript a new execution context is created and is placed on top of current execution context(while stopping the current execution context) in the execution stack.**<br><br>\n",
    "- **This execution context will also go through a creation and execution phase** as did the global execution context. And only **after the completion of execution of this context the previous context execution would resume.**<br><br>\n",
    "- Now inside function a's execution context, during execution phase, we see the invocation statement b(), and therefore yet another execution context is created for the function b and is placed on top of the function a execution context in the execution stack.<br><br>\n",
    "- When b finishes, as it is at the top of the stack, it get's popped out of the execution stack. Then a's execution resumes and it gets over and it popped off.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general patter, every function invocation creates a new execution context, which is pushed to the execution stack, and goes through the create phase and executes the code line by line, finishes and gets popped off the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variable Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/VarEnv.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: **Every execution context has it's own variable environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/VarEnvInExecContext.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see above, that even though myVar is declared 3 times, they are distinct/unique and they don't touch each other because all three of them exist in distinct execution context's variable environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function b(){\n",
    "    console.log(myVar);\n",
    "    var myVar;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function a(){\n",
    "    var myVar = 2;\n",
    "    console.log(myVar);\n",
    "    b();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "var myVar = 1;\n",
    "console.log(myVar);\n",
    "a();\n",
    "console.log(myVar);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above program outputs the following, proving the unique existence of the myVar in 3 different execution context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2 \n",
    "undefined\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Scope Chain\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at the same program as above but with a little change: we didn't declare the myVar variable inside the function b. What happens now?\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function b(){\n",
    "    console.log(myVar);\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "function a(){\n",
    "    var myVar = 2;\n",
    "    console.log(myVar);\n",
    "    b();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "var myVar = 1;\n",
    "console.log(myVar);\n",
    "a();\n",
    "console.log(myVar);\n",
    "```\n",
    "On running this code, we'll get the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1\n",
    "2\n",
    "1\n",
    "1\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can see that in the earlier program's output where it was printed undefined (the log from the function b), now when we removed the declaration myVar, the console.log from function b is printing 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "But why so? Why it printed 1 and not 2 (as b was called from within function a)?<br>\n",
    "This has something to do with the **reference to Outer Environment**, which was provided by the JS Engine in the execution context.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the question is which Outer Environment is referenced by the execution context of function b?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's the **Lexical Environment** of function b. And what is the lexical environment of b? It's the environment/context where the function b is physically present which, after looking at our code, is obviously global context. Therefore, **JS Engine cares about the lexical environment and attaches an execution context's outer environment reference to the context's lexical environment**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TheScopeChain1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, when we ask for a variable while running a line of code inside any particular execution context and if it can't find that variable, it will then look at the outer environment reference and look for that variable there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is recursive, as we can see in the case of nested functions, i.e., if a function x is inside another function y, then first x will search for the asked variable in it's context, then in its outer reference y's context and if it can't even find it there then it goes to y's outer reference env which is the global context.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire act of searching forms a chain of of references to outer environments which could get large because the execution stack could get really tall as, in a given program, there could be many functions within other functions which are ultimately inside the global execution context(which don't have any outer env, that is, outer env = null at global context) at the bottom of the execution stack, this chain is what is referred to as the **Scope Chain**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The scope means: where could I access a variables and the chain is those links of the outer environment references. \n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function a(){\n",
    "    \n",
    "    function b(){\n",
    "    console.log(myVar);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    \n",
    "    b();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "var myVar = 1;\n",
    "a();\n",
    "```\n",
    "For the above code, the scope chain (the chain of outer env references) would look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/TheScopeChain2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope, ES6 and let\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Scope.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: When we call a same function twice, than each of them gets there own execution context with their own variable environment and hence thought it looks like they share the same variables, but actually they are 2 different copies of the variable in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next version of Javascript called the ES6 or ECMA6 or ECMA2015 is introducing a new way of declaring variables using the **let keyword**. Note that it's not replacing var, var is still going to be there but we will get this new way of declaring variables as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "**let allows JS Engine to use block scoping, i.e., the scope of a variable declared using var is only for that particular block (a block is defined as the space b/w two curly braces { }).** **Also, the variables declared using let are also initialized to undefined during the execution context's creation phase**, but unlike variables defined using var keyword, these **let defined variable aren't allowed to be used unless a value is assigned to it during the execution phase**. If they are referenced before assignment in the execution phase, **an error would be thrown**, as the engine won't allow it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Asynchronous Callbacks\n",
    "\n",
    "**As we know that the Javascript itself is Synchronous in nature than how come it handles asynchronous events?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand this we would need to look at the Javascript engine. When we talk about running the JS Engine, we first must understand that the JS Engine doesn't exist by itself inside a browser. There are other engines inside a browser, which are running together with the JS Engine, like the Rendering Engine and Http Request Component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, all those things, **the Rendering engine, the Javascript Engine and other components are running Asynchronously inside the browser. However, inside just the JS Engine everything is synchronous.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already learned about the Execution Stack, together with this execution stack we have an **Event Queue**. The Event Queue contains the occurred events which are supplied to the JS Engine by the browser. These events are kept in the queue waiting to be handled, once the JS Engine gets finished with the Execution stack, i.e., the stack becomes empty, then the JS Engine starts handling the events in the queue in a FIFO manner (if the queue is empty, then it waits for the events to happen and get supplied).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/EventQueue.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Suppose a click event and a HTTP request event happens, now those events are placed in the event queue, and once the execution stack becomes empty, the JS Engine will start processing the events in the queue and see if a particular function needs to be run when that event is triggered. <br><br>\n",
    "- So the JS Engine process the click event and finds out that whether there is a function (clickHandler()) that needs to be run and therefore creates an execution context for that function and puts it on the execution stack and executes it. Once that event is processed, the next event from the queue is picked and the process continues so on and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "// long running function\n",
    "function waitThreeSeconds() {\n",
    "    var ms = 3000 + new Date().getTime();\n",

    "## Conceptual Aside: Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "Javascript, like Python, is dynamically typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/DynamicTyping.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Static Typing: We tell the Engine or the compiler ahead of time that what kind of data we intend to hold inside a variable, therefore languages using static typing have keywords like bool, int, String etc to specify the datatype of a variable. Static Typing is really good when it comes to maintaining and debugging large code bases (as they tend to reduce the chance of errors).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Primitive Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There exist 6 Primitive types of data in Javascript.|\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/PrimitiveTypes.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**undefined**: defines lack of explicit assignment. During the creation phase of the execution context, JS Engine initializes every variable to undefined (it's a good practice to not set a variable to undefined by yourself).\n",
    "\n",
    "**null**: represents that the variable holds nothing. (we can explicitly set a variable to this)\n",
    "\n",
    "**boolean**: that's simply true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "**number**: There is only one numeric type in JS, that's number and it's a floating type number (that is there's always some decimals attached to it). Unlike other programming languages, there's only one numeric type (number), though we can fake integers and floating points, however under the hood they are one and the same (a floating point number) and it can make math weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "**string**: a sequence of characters (both '' and \"\" can be used to specify a string). Unlike other programming languages, where string is considered more complex (an object) but in JS it's a primitive data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**symbol**: This primitive type is new and is introduced in ES6(the next version of JS). As of now, it's not supported by all browsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Aside: Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Operator.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators in JS and many other programming languages are special functions which are syntactically different. Where a normal function is written in sort of prefix way: func_name(params..), an operator has an infix syntax, i.e., it sits between the operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operator Precedence and Associativity\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/OPrecedence.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know that operators are just special functions and that JS is synchronous, therefore in cases where there are multiple operators `3+2*4-1`, means that there are multiple function calls but javascript being synchronous can't run through all functions together and hence there exist a operator precedence(similar to what we have learned in our Math class). In JS, anything with a higher precedence value gets called first. \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the following for order of precedence and associativity: [Order of Precedence and Associativity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)\n",

    "## Conceptual Aside: Coercion\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Coercion.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenarios:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + 2              //results in addition of the two numbers: 3\n",
    "'Hello' + ' There'  //results in concatenation of the two strings: Hello There\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what if we added a number and a string:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 + '2'    //results in a sting '12'.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The maker of JS Engine, made it this way that whenever we add a string and a number, the JS Engine coerce the number operand to a string (it doesn't literally converts but rather finds the string representation of the number operand) and concatenates that with the string operand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because JS is dynamically typed, hence, it tries its best to try to guess what is that the programmer is trying to do and therefore coercion forms a fundamental part of the Javascript language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some quirks when it comes to the comparison operators (hint: coercion is the reason).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following scenario:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "console.log(1 < 2 < 3);  // Output: true\n",
    "console.log(3 < 2 < 1);  // Output: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: The associativity for < operator is left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we get those outputs?<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's look at the first case more closely: `1 < 2 < 3`. Here first `1 < 2` is evaluated and it outputs the value true, now we are left with `true < 3`. Now here, JS Engine performs coercion and coerce the true to a numeric value, which is 1 (can be seen by using Number() function and passing true to it). Therefore, it turns out to be `1 < 3` which is indeed `true` and that justifies the output. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- For the second case: `3 < 2 < 1`. As per the associativity, first the JS Engine would evaluate `3 < 2` which outputs false, next we evaluate `false < 1`, where again the JS Engine does the coercion and converts the value false into a numeric value which would be 0 (as can be seen using Number(false)) and now we have `0 < 1`, which would resolve to `true`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Number(undefined) = NaN (Not a Number) and Number(null) = 0. Thought this built in function (Number) is useful for demonstration purposes, it is not recommended to use them directly in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**While coercion is really powerful, it can also be dangerous.** So wouldn't it be nice if we have a mechanism to make sure that no coercion takes place under certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we look at the **Equality and Inequality operator (== , !=)**, we can see coercion happening there also.\n",

    "\"3\" == 3   // Output: true\n",
    "true == 1  // Output: true\n",
    "false == 0 // Output: true\n",
    "null == 0  // Output: false (that's peculiar)\n",
    "null < 1   // Output: true\n",

    "Hence, the JS Engine performs coercion when the operands aren't of same data type and sometimes the results are unexpected, like on checking Number(null) gives 0, but null == 0 produces false, whereas Number(false) gives 0, and false == 0 produces true. Hence, **the equality operator behaves quite weirdly** and can have side effects if not used properly inside the code. Therefore, coercion can lead to awkward behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "How to tackle this weird behavior?<br>\n",
    "Solution: **Strict Equality and Inequality (===, !==)**. They do the comparison without any attempt to coerce the values. Hence, if the two operand values aren't the same type then strict equality would simply produce false.\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "\"3\" === 3  //Output: false\n",
    "true === 1 //Output: false\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lesson:\n",
    "> Generally, try to only compare those operands which you know would be of the same type. **Using === and !== prevents us from having odd potential errors in our code when comparing values, therefore are recommended and should be used by default**. 99% of the time use === and !=, and only use == and !== when use explicitly want coercion to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following is a reference which contains Sameness comparison Table of different equality operator: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: In addition to == and === it also contains Object.is which would be introduced in ES6 and is an even better comparison function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Coercion to our Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns are used in popular libraries, frameworks and other well written javascript codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Existence and Boolean\n",
    "\n",
    "The values: undefined, null and \"\" represents non-existence. Now if we use another built in function Boolean() to see what these non-existence values coerce to:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "Boolean(undefined) //Output: false\n",
    "Boolean(null)      //Output: false\n",
    "Boolean(\"\")        //Output: false\n",
    "Boolean(0)         //Output: false\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hence non-existent values get coerced to boolean false, while the rest are coerced to true. Hence we can take advantage of this coercing to evaluate whether something exists or not as demonstrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var data;\n",
    "//code that goes to the Internet and fetches some data and puts it into data variable\n",
    "\n",
    "if(data){\n",
    " console.log(\"There is something\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else {\n",
    " console.log('Nothing is found');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now in the if( ) statement the stuff b/w the parenthesis must resolve to a boolean, that is, true or false, the JS Engine would coerce the value/expression b/w the () to a boolean, therefore, here it would coerce our data variable into a boolean, and if there would be something in the data variable (other than \"\", null, undefined) then the data variable would be coerced to true and false otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **we can use coercion mechanism to our advantage by checking whether a variable has some value, something other than undefined, null or \"\".** However, there is a caveat, as we saw Boolean(0) also results in false. So, if there is any chance that our data variable could endup being zero (and that zero being significant to our purpose) than the above code would cause a problem, as if our variable data = 0, then if condition would coerce 0 to false and else would be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get around this problem, we can modify our condition slightly\n",
    "```js\n",
    "var data;\n",
    "//code that goes to the Internet and fetches some data and puts it into data variable\n",
    "\n",
    "if(data || data === 0){\n",
    " console.log(\"There is something\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "else {\n",
    " console.log('Nothing is found');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now even if value of our data variable turns out to be 0, the if condition would eval to true because === has a higher precedence value than ||, so data === 0 would be ran first and if our data = 0, so this would evaluate to true and it would cause the overall or condition (||) to be true and hence the if block would be executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Default Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following code:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function greet(name){\n",
    "    console.log('Hey' + name)\n",
    "}\n",
    "greet()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code would output: `Hey undefined`. Because, when the function is invoked, an execution context is created and in the creation phase, all the variables of the function are initialized to undefined. Now in the execution phase, when we console.log, the name parameter has the value undefined, as no argument was passed to name. But that's not an ideal behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we want a default value for the parameter name?<br>\n",
    "Well, ES6 is going to introduce a syntax to set a default value. For current/legacy javascript code in a lot of software we see a neat trick for setting a default value, which would look like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function greet(name){\n",
    "    name = name || 'Mr. X';\n",
    "    console.log('Hey' + name);\n",
    "}\n",
    "greet();\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now why that `name = name || 'Mr.X'` results in name variable having the value `Mr.X`:\n",
    "- firstly, as the || have higher precedence as compared to =, so || would run first\n",
    "- and because the || operator returns a value that can be coerced to true, so if name is undefined, hence coercing to false, than the || operator would return `Mr. X` which coerce to true. If both the values coerce to true `'hey' || 'hi'` then || will return the value as per its associativity, which is left to right and hence would return `'hey'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "And be aware of 0 again, as if we do greet(0), then also name variable would have the value \"Mr. X\" because zero coerces to boolean false."
