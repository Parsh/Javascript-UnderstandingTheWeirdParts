    "\n",
    "In computer technology, **a parser is a program, usually part of a compiler, that receives input in the form of sequential source program instructions**, interactive online commands, markup tags, or some other defined interface **and breaks them up into parts (for example, the nouns (objects), verbs (methods), and their attributes or options) that can then be managed by other components** (for example, other components in a compiler). A parser may also check to see that all input has been provided that is necessary.\n",

    "## Lexical Environment\n",
    "![](./Images/LexicalEnvironment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about lexical environment for a given piece of code, say a function, we are basically talking about where that piece of code is written and what surrounds it. This is what compilers/interpreters takes into consideration while parsing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Context\n",
    "![](./Images/ExecutionContext.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that execution context not only just wraps the code that's running but it also contain code, injected by the execution engine (compiler/interpreter), beyond what we have provided. \n"
