    "### Syntax Parser\n",
    "![](./Images/SyntaxParser.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer technology, **a parser is a program, usually part of a compiler, that receives input in the form of sequential source program instructions**, interactive online commands, markup tags, or some other defined interface **and breaks them up into parts (for example, the nouns (objects), verbs (methods), and their attributes or options) that can then be managed by other components** (for example, other components in a compiler). A parser may also check to see that all input has been provided that is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lexical Environment\n",
    "![](./Images/LexicalEnvironment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we talk about lexical environment for a given piece of code, say a function, we are basically talking about where that piece of code is written and what surrounds it. This is what compilers/interpreters takes into consideration while parsing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Context\n",
    "![](./Images/ExecutionContext.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that execution context not only just wraps the code that's running but it also contain code, injected by the execution engine (compiler/interpreter), beyond what we have provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conceptual Aside: Name-Value Pairs and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Name-Value Pair\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/NVPair.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "Address = \"100 Main St.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/Objects-NV.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```js\n",
    "Address = {\n",
    "    Street: 'Main',\n",
    "    Number: 100,\n",
    "    Apartment: {\n",
    "        Floor : 3,\n",
    "        Number : 200\n",
    "        }\n",
    "   }\n",

    "## The Global Environment and The Global Object\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a code is run in JS, it runs inside an Execution context, built by the Execution Engine, to wrap the supplied code. **While running a JS program there are a few execution context running normally, however there is a base Execution context which is our Global Execution Context.**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/GEandGO.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the JS Engine creates the Global Execution context, places our code into it and provides the following:\n",
    "- **Global Object**\n",
    "- a variable: **this**\n",
    "- a **link/reference to the Outer Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: At a global level, this = Global Object and Outer environment reference = null (cuz their is nothing outer to global context).\n",
    "\n",
    "> The execution environment was created by the JS Engine and therefore it decides what would be the Global Object and the value of this based on the context. For ex: In web browser the JS engine sets the Global Object as well as the value of this variable to be the **window object** (which is the global object for browsers), whereas for the server side, i.e., node js there would be some other global object, but there will always be a global object provided by the JS Engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just to be clear, global in Javascript is anything that's not inside or lexically not inside a function. Therefore, any variable or function that isn't inside any function is globally accessible and is directly attached to the global object (window in browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Execution Context Creation and Hoisting\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the following scenario, what normally would you expect? \n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "\n",
    "b()\n",
    "console.log(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "var a = 'Hey There';\n",
    "\n",
    "function b(){\n",
    "    console.log('Greetings');\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is something peculiar that's going to happen if we run that code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Greetings\n",
    "undefined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we get such an output? Clearly that wouldn't have been the case in other programming languages. Instead of throwing an error, the function b got executed and console.log(a) produced something called undefined.\n",
    "\n",
    "This, seemingly peculiar, output is a result of a phenomenon called **Hoisting**. To understand what hoisting is, we would need to look deeper into what happens when execution context is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Execution Context is created in 2 phases**:\n",
    "1. Creation Phase\n",
    "2. Execution Phase\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./Images/ExecContextCreation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, during the creation phase, the JS Engine sets up Global Object, this variable, reference to Outer Environment together with memory space for variables and functions. **This setting up of memory space for variables and functions at the time of execution context creation is referred, somewhat confusingly, as Hoisting.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**So before the code (our code) begins to be executed line by line, the JS Engine already have set aside memory space for all the variables and the functions that we have created . Hence, those functions and the variables exists in memory prior to the execution phase.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that the function is placed in its entirety, with its local variables, into the memory however the game with variables is a bit different, the assignment of values to the variables only takes place during the execution phase therefore Javascript Engine don't know, at the time of creation phase, what that value would be and hence it puts a placeholder called undefined** (that's why the output contained undefined while logging a). So, in short, all the variables are first initialized to undefined and gain their values during the execution phase whereas the functions are placed in the memory in their entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This elegantly proves the fact that we wrote isn't what's directly being executed rather an execution context is built which wraps our code along with other stuff."
